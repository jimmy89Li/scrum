# What

Scrum is a simple, incredible and powerful set of principles and practices that help teams to develop product in small time.
The force of SCRUM is the fast feedback and the rapid adaptation to changes; this makes possible to develop a product fastly even if you ideas are not well defined.

Why Is It Called Scrum?
When Jeff Sutherland created the scrum process in 1993, he borrowed the term "scrum" from an analogy put forth in a 1986 study by Takeuchi and Nonaka, published in the Harvard Business Review. In that study, Takeuchi and Nonaka compare high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by Rugby teams.

Scrum is the leading agile development methodology, used by Fortune 500 companies around the world.


# Who

The roles:

* __Product Owner__: Is the responsible of the investiment, except for the responsability of the capital he doesn't take any kind of decision. He is, of course, the responsible of the __ROI__ (Return on Investiment, how much have the product earn/ the cost). As long as he is the responsabile of the investiments, he is certainly the final arbiter about requirement questions. Product owner is generally focused on what (instead of How).
* __Scrum Development Team__: The team is a crossfunctional group where anyone is specialized in something different, the aim of the scrum development team is to perform and increment the product in every __Sprint__. There are not any hierarchical levels: everyone has to collaborate and the group have to self organizing.
* __Scrum Master__: He is the facilitator between __Product Owner__ and the __Scrum Development Team__. He has not any management authority (non hierarchical theory) and he doesn't have a project management role as well.


# When

Sprint Planning Meeting
In Scrum, every iteration begins with the sprint planning meeting. At this meeting, the Product Owner and the team negotiate which stories a team will tackle that sprint. Time-boxed to four hours, this meeting is a conversation between the Product Owner and the team. That is, it’s up to the Product Owner to decide which stories are of the highest priority to the release and which will generate the highest business value, but the team has the power to push back and voice concerns or impediments. This is a good thing since the team may be aware of a legitimate impediment keeping the team from moving forward.

When the team agrees to tackle the work, the Product Owner adds the corresponding stories into the sprint backlog. We usually recommend this be physically represented by moving a Post-It note or index card with a story written on it from the backlog into the sprint backlog. If a team uses an agile tooling solution, this might be represented in a number of ways. A tool my company uses, ScrumWorks® Pro, has a two-paned view of a project, in which the product backlog appears on the right and the sprint backlog on the left. Using an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface, the Product Owner can easily add stories to the sprint.

At this point, the Product Owner may choose to leave while the team decomposes the sprint backlog items into tasks, though he or she is still expected to be available to answer questions, clarify Product Backlog Items, or renegotiate. This meeting, which was previously called the sprint definition meeting, is also time-boxed to four hours to limit all sprint planning activities to a single day’s time.

Now that sprint goals are defined, the team is ready to get to work. Of course, other meetings also happen during the sprint, which I’ll discuss.

Watch an example Sprint Planning Meeting.

* The Daily Standup
  The heart of the Scrum process is the daily standup meeting, also known as the daily Scrum. This meeting helps ensure that    the entire development team is always on the same page. Every day, the Scrum team gathers together, usually in a team room    or private office—to report on the progress made since the last meeting, goals for the next one, and any impediments          blocking their path. These reports are often phrased as responses to the following three questions:

  What have I done since the last Scrum meeting (yesterday)?
  What will I do before the next Scrum meeting (tomorrow)?
  What prevents me from performing my work as well as possible?
  This meeting should not exceed 15 minutes. If members of the team need to discuss an issue that cannot be covered in that amount of time, it is recommended they attend a “sidebar” meeting following the standup. This allows team members to attend meetings that directly involve their work, instead of sitting through irrelevant meetings. Unfortunately, daily Scrums often last longer than 15 minutes. To compensate, many teams use stop watches or timers to uphold the time limitations. Also, to limit distracting small talk, many teams employ a talking stick or mascot, which a team member must hold to speak in the meeting. Upon finishing an update, the talking stick is then passed to the next team member, who reports, and so on.
  
  When the daily Scrum meeting is held is for the team and Product Owner to decide, but most Scrum literature encourages teams to hold the meeting as soon as all the team members arrive in the morning.
 

* Sprint Review and Retrospective Meetings
  When the sprint ends, it’s time for the team to present its work to the Product Owner. This is known as the sprint review meeting. At this time, the Product Owner asks the team to demonstrate a potentially shippable product increment. The Product Owner declares which items are truly done or not. Teams commonly discover that a story’s final touches often excise the most effort and time. Partially done work should not be called “done.”
  
  After the sprint review meeting, the team and the ScrumMaster get together for the retrospective meeting. During this meeting, the team considers what went well, what didn’t, and what improvements could be made in the next sprint. Team members should be able to speak frankly about the sprint’s successes and failures. It’s an especially important opportunity for the team to focus on its effectiveness and identify strategies to improve its processes. Moreover, it allows the ScrumMaster to observe common impediments that impact the team and then work to resolve them.
