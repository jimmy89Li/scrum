Scrum is a simple, incredible and powerful set of principles and practices that help teams to develop product in small time.
The force of SCRUM is the fast feedback and the rapid adaptation to changes; this makes possible to develop a product fastly even if you ideas are not well defined.

Why Is It Called Scrum?
When Jeff Sutherland created the scrum process in 1993, he borrowed the term "scrum" from an analogy put forth in a 1986 study by Takeuchi and Nonaka, published in the Harvard Business Review. In that study, Takeuchi and Nonaka compare high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by Rugby teams.

Scrum is the leading agile development methodology, used by Fortune 500 companies around the world.
