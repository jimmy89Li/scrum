Scrum is a simple, incredible and powerful set of principles and practices that help teams to develop product in small time.
The force of SCRUM is the fast feedback and the rapid adaptation to changes; this makes possible to develop a product fastly even if you ideas are not well defined.

Why Is It Called Scrum?
When Jeff Sutherland created the scrum process in 1993, he borrowed the term "scrum" from an analogy put forth in a 1986 study by Takeuchi and Nonaka, published in the Harvard Business Review. In that study, Takeuchi and Nonaka compare high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by Rugby teams.

Scrum is the leading agile development methodology, used by Fortune 500 companies around the world.


# Who

The roles:

* __Product Owner__: Is the responsible of the investiment, except for the responsability of the capital he doesn't take any kind of decision. He is, of course, the responsible of the __ROI__ (Return on Investiment, how much have the product earn/ the cost). As long as he is the responsabile of the investiments, he is certainly the final arbiter about requirement questions. Product owner is generally focused on what (instead of How).
* __Scrum Development Team__: The team is a crossfunctional group where anyone is specialized in something different, the aim of the scrum development team is to perform and increment the product in every __Sprint__. There are not anyhierarchical levels: everyone has to collaborate and the group have to self organizing.
